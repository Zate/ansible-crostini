# Ansible-Crostini

This module is used to setup crostini from scratch.
You can use this as an example to write your own, but I suggest not using it 
verbatim, as it has a number of settings that are specific to me.


To run:
```
apt-get update
apt-get install -y ansible
ansible-playbook crostini.yml
```
